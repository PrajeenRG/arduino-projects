# Arduino Beginner Projects
Contains all the codes that I wrote to learn Arduino UNO as a beginner. 
Some of these projects will be as simple as connecting LEDs but thats significant in the part of learning.

### Project List
- Blinking LED
- Traffic Lights

### How do I run the projects?
Clone the repo to any directory and open the same. After doing all the necessary circuitry, open the project file
and make the modifications as necessary and verify them using Arduino IDE. Once, everything is correct,
upload the same to the Arduino UNO board and watch the fun.

### So what's Pending?
As of now the major focus is on learning the code writing part of Arduino so the corresponding circuit
diagrams aren't included with this repo. Once the projects have been done, the repo will be restructured
to include the relevant circuitries too.
